<p><strong>Rationale and Workshop Goals</strong></p>
<p>Paleontology is oftentimes a core research emphasis of many U.S. natural history museum collections. The <em>iDigBio</em> is sponsoring this workshop to address the digitization needs, opportunities and Grand Challenges of the paleontological collections community throughout the U.S.&nbsp;Workshop participation has been determined by invitation only in order to maximize the best possible cross-section of experience while maintaining a smaller group size that is conducive to open discussion.</p>
<p><em>The specific goals of this workshop are to:</em></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Allow a forum for dialog and communication among the paleontological collections sub-disciplines (vertebrate, invertebrate, paleobotany, and microfossils).</li>
	<li>
		Present examples of on-going digitization initiatives among the neontological collections communities and examples of currently funded digitization projects.</li>
	<li>
		Facilitate dialog between the paleo and neontological collections communities to promote integration of collection data.</li>
	<li>
		Facilitate a discussion of the collections digitization needs, priorities, and Grand Challenges for the paleo community.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Intended Outcomes</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Increased awareness of digitization needs, opportunities, and Grand Challenges within the paleo community.</li>
	<li>
		Increased awareness and understanding of the paleo community of digitization activities within the neontological community, and vice-versa.</li>
	<li>
		Report from this workshop to be posted on iDigBio website and sent to NSF as part of report.</li>
	<li>
		New collaborations/network(s) formed.</li>
	<li>
		Formation of Paleocollections working group.</li>
	<li>
		Follow-up activities at GSA, SPNCH, etc.</li>
